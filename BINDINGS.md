# Scenario hooks guides
## Basic auth hook
In order to make basic authentication work user should do the following:
* @BasicAuth tag should be added to scenario which requires authentication
* AutomationConfig.json should have credentials for basic auth. Please refer to [example](Behavioral.Automation.DemoBindings/AutomationConfig.json).
* If you want to use credentials from different sources IBasicAuthConfig interface can be used
* To ignore basic auth on given env the IgnoreAuth field can be used to disable basic auth
